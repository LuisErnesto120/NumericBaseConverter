# Base Converter
Wrote in python 3 by somebody who doesn't really know how to use python properly.
Uses numpy for probably no reason, but I couldn't figure out how lists work lol.

# What it does
The converter takes a number in base 10 and turns it into base n.

For now it only does base 10 to base n. :/

Also, it generates a LaTeX table if you want. ;)

# Things you need
Python, numpy (for now), patience to deal with some terrible code if you want to help.

# Things to do (you can help if you want)
Base n to base m conversion (basically just adding a base n to base 10 converter and calling it when n != 10).

Change numpy arrays to lists, so it only needs base python.

Learn to code better (probably you won't be able to help on this one).
